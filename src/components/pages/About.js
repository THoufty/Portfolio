      As an entry-level web developer, I have experience in handling HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and have worked with both MySQL using Sequelize and MongoDB using Mongoose for database management. I also have a strong understanding of PWA and React. I am excited to continue learning and growing as a web developer and am eager to take on new challenges.
